For this lab, you will create a basic website using HTML and CSS. This website can be for anything you want, but should not be too similar to the website you built for Lab 1. You must create your own original work.

This is your chance to be creative and build anything you want -- a book store, a social media site, or anything else. You are welcome to provide "fake" data for the website. For example, you can't build a complete clone of Instagram, since you won't have a database, interactive front end, etc. But you could mock up what a clone of Instagram would look like, including pages to show a stream of photos, upload a photo, login to your account, etc.

You are also welcome to use the creative projects throughout the semester to slowly build up a big project. So if you want to build a store, you could start mocking up some of the pages for this project, and then add other parts later. If you build a single website over the course of multiple creative projects, you must add new functionality in each assignment.

Pair Programming
You are welcome to work in a a group of two for this assignment or you can do it by yourself.  Most students find that the assignment is easier and you learn more if you work in a group.

Requirements
This is a creative project, so you are welcome to build what you would like. The basic requirements are:

- A home page
- Three or more additional pages
- The site uses some images
- The site uses Bootstrap for a menu
- A footer that lists the URL for your GitHub repository
You may not build a portfolio or personal website, since this was done in Lab 1. Build something completely new from scratch.

Submission
Please submit to Canvas the URL for your web server, where your code is running (e.g. on your DigitalOcean server). On this website, in a footer, you must include a link to your GitHub repository. Use a unique URL for the project, e.g. cp1.emmasmith.org.

If you worked with a pair programming partner, both of you should submit the assignment and both of you should list the other person's name in the website footer and in the assignment submission.

Rubric for Grading
We will grade your projects based on:

- You met all the requirements
- How well you follow web design principles: spacing, typography, color, consistency, and responsive design.
TAs will assign scores in these ranges:

- 50 points: Meets the basic requirements of using HTML and CSS, with four total pages, and a footer
- 30 points: Has a responsive Bootstrap menu that is customized
- 20 points: Uses good web design principles. 4 points each for:
responsive design -- the site should work as well on mobile as on desktops; mobile-first designs for mobile, then expands to desktop
white space -- use white space effectively to highlight different areas of the page and to make the site easy to understand
typography -- use appropriate font sizes and paragraph widths to distinguish the importance of different sections and to make the site easy to read

consistency -- everything should match

color -- use color effectively to make the site appealing -- start with a black and white design and add color last, use colors that are complementary
